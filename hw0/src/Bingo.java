            /*  now you can write your own solution to hw0
             *  you can follow the instruction described below:
             * 
             *  1. read the rest content of the file
             *  2. store the announce strings (2nd line of the file) in variable announce
             *  3. store the matrix (from the 3rd line to the end of the file) in variable matrix
             *  4. compare the matrix and announce strings (this is the tricky part)
             *  5. output how many 'straight line' are there in the matrix
             * 
             *  [note]
             *  you can use every data structure in standard Java packages (Java 8 supported)
             *  the packages in stdlib.jar and algs4.jar are also available for you to use
             *
             *  [hint]
             *  1. you should check whether Java pass the variable by references or by values.
             *  2. some data structure such as HashSet, HashMap, Arrays, ArrayList, Vector are very
             *     useful for solving problems.
